Role-based access control
=========================

Coaster provides a :class:`RoleMixin` class that can be used to define role-based access
control to the attributes and methods of any SQLAlchemy model. :class:`RoleMixin` is a
base class for :class:`~coaster.sqlalchemy.BaseMixin` and applies to all derived classes.

Roles are freeform string tokens. A model may freely define and grant roles to
users based on internal criteria. The following standard tokens are
recommended. Required tokens are granted by :class:`RoleMixin` itself.

1. ``all``: Any user, authenticated or anonymous (required)
2. ``anon``: Anonymous user (required)
3. ``user``: Logged in user or user token (required)
4. ``creator``: The creator of an object (may or may not be the current owner)
5. ``owner``: The current owner of an object
6. ``author``: Author of the object's contents
7. ``editor``: Someone authorised to edit the object
8. ``reader``: Someone authorised to read the object (assuming it's not public)

Example use::

    from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
    from coaster.sqlalchemy import BaseMixin, set_roles

    app = Flask(__name__)
    db = SQLAlchemy(app)

    A proxy interface that wraps an object and provides passthrough read and

    Consults the ``__roles__`` dictionary on the object for determining which roles can
    access which attributes. Provides both attribute and dictionary interfaces.

    Note that if the underlying attribute is a callable, calls are controlled
    by the read action. Care should be taken when the callable mutates the
    object.

    :class:`RoleAccessProxy` is typically accessed directly from the target
    object via :meth:`~RoleMixin.access_for` (from :class:`RoleMixin`).

    Example::
