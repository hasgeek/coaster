Role-based access control
-------------------------

Coaster provides a :class:`RoleMixin` class that can be used to define role-based access
control to the attributes and methods of any SQLAlchemy model. :class:`RoleMixin` is a
base class for :class:`~coaster.sqlalchemy.mixins.BaseMixin` and applies to all derived
classes. Access is defined as one of 'call' (for methods), 'read' or 'write' (both for
attributes).

Roles are freeform string tokens. A model may freely define and grant roles to actors
(users and sometimes client apps) based on internal criteria. The following standard tokens
are recommended. Required tokens are granted by :class:`RoleMixin` itself.

1. ``all``: Any actor, authenticated or anonymous (required)
2. ``anon``: Anonymous actor (required)
3. ``auth``: Authenticated actor (required)
4. ``creator``: The creator of an object (may or may not be the current owner)
5. ``owner``: The current owner of an object
6. ``author``: Author of the object's contents (all creators are authors)
7. ``editor``: Someone authorised to edit the object
8. ``reader``: Someone authorised to read the object (assuming it's not public)
9. ``subject``: User who is described by an object, typically having limited rights

Example use::
